    <h1>#3 Power</h1>
        <h2>Write a function named "power" that takes two arguments (x and n) and returns the the result of raising x to the nth power.

                You may not use built-in arithmetic operators or functions. Instead, use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function.
                
                Display the result of calling power(2, 8), which should be 256.

    <h1>#4 Factorial</h1>
        <h2>Write a function named "factorial" that takes a single argument and returns the factorial of that argument.

                You may not use built-in arithmetic operators or functions. Instead, use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function.
                
                Display their result of calling factorial(4), which should be 24 (4 * 3 * 2 * 1).

    <h1>#5 Fibonacci</h1>
        <h2>Write a function named "fibonacci" that takes an argument n and returns the nth, Fibonacci number (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (click me!).

                You may not use built-in arithmetic operators or functions. Instead, use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function.
                 
                Display the result of calling fibonacci(8), which should be 13:
